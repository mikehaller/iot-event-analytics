# TODO: hrm1imb - Activate C++ Scanning by using Build Wrapper -> requires setup and more effort
#
#Error:
#The only way to get an accurate analysis of C/C++/Objective-C files is by using the SonarSource build-wrapper and setting the property "sonar.cfamily.build-wrapper-output" or by using Clang Compilation Database and setting the property "sonar.cfamily.compile-commands". None of these two options were specified.
#
#If you don't want to analyze C/C++/Objective-C files, then prevent them from being analyzed by setting the following properties:
#
sonar.c.file.suffixes=-
sonar.cpp.file.suffixes=-
sonar.objc.file.suffixes=-
